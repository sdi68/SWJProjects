## Features
### Digital Projects Catalog
Component provides the creation and operation of digital projects catalog (programs, files, scripts, extensions, modules, etc.) and allows you to manage their description, characteristics and provides the ability of downloads.

### Paid download
Thanks to the key manager, you can organize paid downloads on your site.  
To do this, just select in the project "Download Type: Paid" and then you can download the file only if the key is specified.

### Versioning
Component provides versioning of digital projects with the ability to specify the stability (Development, Alpha, Beta, Release Candidate, Stable) and changelog management.

### Statistical functionality
Component includes statistical functionality with ability to track the count of downloads for each specific version.

### File storage
File storage structure allows you to store files outside the root directory, which provides a high degree of protection and excludes downloading by direct link to the file, bypassing the component.

### For Joomla! developers
Developers who create extensions for Joomla! CMS are provided with additional functionality for creating and running their own update server, as part of the component.
